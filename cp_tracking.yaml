  data_dir: "C:/Users/dir/"  # absolute path to folder where the data file is, and also to write output
  data_name: "data_name" # data file name without ".tiff"

parameters:
  pixel_size: 1.0 # in nm/pixel
  distance_from_center: 40 # in nm, distance from the center of the kymograph to one edge in the y-axis
  top_pixels: 20 # tracking the feature from the defined pixel position (from the top) in the y-axis
  bottom_pixels: 20 # tracking the feature until the defined pixel position (from the bottom) in the y-axis
  border: -10 # in nm. local maxima will be detected above this height border.
  cutoff_length: 6 # in nm, for low-pass filter. This usally should not be changed

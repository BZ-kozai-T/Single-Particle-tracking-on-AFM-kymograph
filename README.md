# Single Particle tracking on AFM kymograph
Python code to track a single particle in the fast-scan axis of the kymograph generated by high speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM).
It shoeld be noted that the kymograph needs to be prepared as a single image and that the x- and y-axis of the kymograph need to be scan direction and time, repsectively. 

This tracking algorithm was used to analyze the central plug (CP) positions within nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) measured by HS-AFM line scanning.

To run the script:

1. Make sure that all libraries in "libraries.txt" are installed
2. Enter the parameters required in the "cp_tracking.yaml" file
3. Type, "cp_tracking_kymo.py -p cp_tracking.yaml" in Terminal

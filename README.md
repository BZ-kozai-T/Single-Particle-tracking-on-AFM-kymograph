# Single Particle tracking on AFM kymograph
Python code to track a single particle in the fast-scan axis of the kymograph generated by high speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM).
It should be noted that the kymograph needs to be prepared as a single image beforehand, and that the y- and x-axis of the kymograph are scan direction and time (left to right), repsectively. 
This tracking algorithm was used to analyze the plug positions within nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) or Nsp1FG-functionalized DNA origami scaffolds measured by HS-AFM line scanning.

The script has been tested on Python v3.9, Windows 11 v23H2 OS Build 22631.3007.

To run the script:

1. make sure that all libraries written in "requirements.txt" are installed into your working environment
2. directory download the "cp_tracking.py" and "cp_tracking.yaml" files
3. enter the parameters required in the "cp_tracking.yaml" file. Instructions can be found in the yaml file.
4. type the following command in Terminal: "cp_tracking_kymo.py -p cp_tracking.yaml"
5. press "Enter" to run

In the test folder, there is an example kymograph data. You can test the code on the data.
The run time is around 5 seconds on the example data.
   
The outputs will be two files:

1. a csv file contaning pixel positions in the y-axis (the top position is 0), nanometer distance from the center of the kymograph in the y-axis, and radius from the center of the kymograph in the y-axis.
2. a png file of the kymograph overlaid trajectory

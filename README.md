# Single Particle tracking on AFM kymograph
This is a tracking algorithm for single particle on kymograph generated by high speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM).
Note: the algorithm has been tested only for particle within a confined area (such as a pore) so far.

To run the script:
Make sure that all packages listed in libraries.txt are installed.

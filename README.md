# Single Particle tracking on AFM kymograph
This is a tracking algorithm for single particle in the fast-scan axis of the kymograph generated by high speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM).
Note: the x- and y-axis of the kymograph need to be scan-axis and time, repsectively. 

To run the script:
1. Make sure that all packages listed in libraries.txt are installed.
2. Enter the parameters in the "cp_tracking.yaml" file.
3. Type, "cp_tracking_kymo.py -p cptracking.yaml" in Terminal
